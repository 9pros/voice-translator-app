- **VoiceService**: Manages voice recognition, recording, and text-to-speech
- **Real-time Processing**: Streams audio chunks for continuous translation

#### Voice Profiles
- **Profile Creation**: Record voice samples to create personalized profiles
- **Voice Training**: Process audio samples to extract voice characteristics
- **Profile Management**: Store, activate, and manage multiple voice profiles

#### Call Integration
- **Dialer Interface**: Custom dialer with contact integration
- **Call Management**: Handle call states and audio routing
- **Translation Overlay**: Real-time translation display during calls

## API Integration

### Translation APIs
- **OpenAI GPT**: Primary translation service with context awareness
- **Google Translate**: Fallback translation service
- **Azure Translator**: Alternative translation provider

### Voice Processing
